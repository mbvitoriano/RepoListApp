# Repositories List

Hi there!
This is my very fisrt React App!
This app was made following a course given by [Rocket Seat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), the main functionality is to list a series of "products" (in this case a list of github repositories) based on a api requisiton.
 The items are paginated, allowing the user to navigate through them.
 
 In my project ive used my own API created with [Node JS](https://github.com/nodejs/node), but to simplify i've used the Rocket Seat's API.
  


## Example

Here's a gif showing the main functionaliies of the app:

* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
* [API Rocket Seat](http://rocketseat-node.herokuapp.com/api/products) - List of entries to the App
